        <p>The following information is provided to inform you about the research project and your participation in
          it. Please read this form carefully. You have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have about this study
          and the information given below by contacting study personnel (see contact information below). You are
          welcome to print or save a copy of this information for your future reference. </p>
        <p>Your participation in this research study is voluntary. You are also free to withdraw from this study at
          any time. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise
          entitled, and you may discontinue participation at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which you are
          otherwise entitled. In the event new information becomes available that may affect the risks or benefits
          associated with this research study or your willingness to participate in it, you will be notified so that
          you can make an informed decision whether or not to continue your participation in this study. </p>
        <h2>Purpose of the study: </h2>
        <p>The purpose of the study is to evaluate the utility of new user centered design software in collecting
          feedback on software user interface design to support user-centered design. This new software is being
          compared with the current standard for user-centered design, which are participatory design workshops.</p>
        <p>You are being asked to participate in a research study because you are a NICU provider, and the example
          application is to help design an EHR-integrated neonatal service handoff list. <strong></strong></p>
        <h2>Procedures to be followed and approximate duration of the study:</h2>
        <p><strong>You have been randomized to participate by using the new design software</strong>. Using the
          software, you will engage in designing and customizing a neonatal handoff document.</p>
        <p>Prior to the session, you will be asked to complete a demographics survey and provide information about
          your
          role requirements. Following the session, we will ask you to complete a short post-activity survey to
          evaluate
          the usability of the process.</p>
        <p>For this activity, imagine you are giving or receiving a printed neonatal service list handoff document
          prior
          to covering the intensive care unit overnight. You will be covering the service in your normal role with
          your
          normal support team present as well. You will be presented with a list of hypothetical neonatal patients who
          represent various neonatal conditions. Initially, only the patient name will be visible. As you select
          additional patient information, it will begin to populate the patient list accordingly. You will also be
          able
          to customize how that data is displayed. Once you have the handoff document customized to your preferences,
          click on the save and submit button to send your customizations to the design team.</p>
        <p>The goal of this activity is for you to be able to share your specific preferences with a design team who
          is
          creating an EHR-integrated neonatal handoff tool. We will aggregate your individual submission with data
          from
          other neonatal providers to help determine how to create a neonatal handoff document that best supports you
          with the information and format you need to fulfill your specific role.</p>
        <p>The estimated time required for participation using this new software is 10-30 minutes, although you may
          take
          as much time as you wish. You may also use the link in your email to return to the software to update or
          complete your selections at a future date.</p>
        <h2>Expected costs:</h2>
        <p>There are no expected monetary costs to you for participating in this study. The only cost to you will be
          the
          time required to complete your entry.</p>
        <h2>Description of the discomforts, inconveniences, and/or risks that can be reasonably expected as a result
          of
          participation in this study: </h2>
        <p>The risks to you are minimal. This study poses no direct medical risks to you. No invasive testing or
          procedures will be conducted. The research team will make every effort to protect your privacy. You have the
          option to withdraw from the study at any time.</p>
        <h2>Compensation in case of study-related injury:</h2>
        <p>If it is determined by Vanderbilt and the Investigator that an injury occurred as a direct result of the
          tests or treatments that are done for research, then you and/or your insurance will not have to pay for the
          cost of immediate medical care provided at Vanderbilt to treat the injury.</p>
        <p>There are no plans for Vanderbilt to pay for the costs of any additional care. There are no plans for
          Vanderbilt to give you money for the injury.</p>
        <h2>Good effects that might result from this study: </h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>The benefits to science and humankind that <u>might</u> result from this study.</strong></li>
          <p>The results of this study may assist patients and healthcare providers by better informing how to design
            and evaluate medical software that is used for clinical care. There may be no direct benefits to
            participants.</p>

          <li><strong>The benefits you might get from being in this study.</strong></li>

          <p>The specific data from the use case in this study may be used to help design a NICU patient handoff list,
            which could potentially be used by participants in this study. </p>
        </ol>
        <h2>Compensation for participation:</h2>
        <p>There will not be specific compensation for participation.</p>
        <h2>Circumstances under which the Principal Investigator may withdraw you from study participation:</h2>
        <p>The Principal Investigator may withdraw you from the study if you express interest in discontinuing
          participation in the study. </p>
        <h2>What happens if you choose to withdraw from study participation:</h2>
        <p>You may choose to withdraw from the study at any time. Nothing will happen to you if you withdraw from the
          study. If you choose not to submit your neonatal handoff to the design team, no data from your design will
          be
          used in the final analysis. If you choose not to participate in the study or to discontinue participation
          early, this decision will not affect the result of this study.</p>
